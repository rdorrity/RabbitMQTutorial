Messaging with RabbitMQ

This guide walks you through the process of setting up a RabbitMQ AMQP server that publishes and subscribes to messages and creating a Spring Boot application to interact with that RabbitMQ server.
What You Will Build

You will build an application that publishes a message by using Spring AMQPâ€™s RabbitTemplate and subscribes to the message on a POJO by using MessageListenerAdapter.
What You Need

    About 15 minutes

    A favorite text editor or IDE

    JDK 1.8 or later

    Gradle 4+ or Maven 3.2+

    You can also import the code straight into your IDE:

        Spring Tool Suite (STS)

        IntelliJ IDEA

            Set up the RabbitMQ server. See Set up the RabbitMQ Broker.
